# 📝 Simple Blog Manager

A basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application for managing blog posts using a mock JSON Server API and JavaScript. This project allows users to view blog titles, read full post details, add new posts, and delete posts in a simple UI.

---

## 📖 Description

This project was built as a coding challenge to demonstrate frontend interaction with a mock backend using `json-server`. The application displays a list of blog post titles. Users can:

- Click on a title to view post details
- Add new posts using a form
- Delete existing posts

The data is fetched from a mock API powered by `json-server`, and the frontend is written using vanilla JavaScript and styled with CSS.
